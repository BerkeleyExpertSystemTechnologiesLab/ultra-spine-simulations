# ultra-spine-simulations

Copyright 2015 Berkeley Emergent Space Technologies Lab.

Simulations work for the Underactuated Lightweight Tensegrity Robotic Assistive Spine. This is the branch that contains the results for the submission to the American Control Conference 2017. For those results, please look in:

- Dynamics derivation (sec. II): dynamics/3d-dynamics-symbolicsolver
- Model predictive control algorithm (sec. III/IV): control/mpc
- Data from these tests (sec. VI, VII): data/mpc_data

This branch does not include most of the other simulations work for the spine (e.g, inverse kinematics and 2D analytical dynamics models.)
See the main branch for those simulations.
